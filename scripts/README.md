# Achievement Management Scripts

This directory contains scripts to help manage achievements in your Watchlistfy application.

## Add Achievements Script

The `add_achievements.go` script allows you to easily add achievements to your MongoDB database without using MongoDB Compass.

### Prerequisites

1. Make sure you have Go installed on your system
2. Ensure your `.env` file is properly configured with `MONGO_ATLAS_URI`
3. The script assumes your database name is "watchlistfy" - modify if different

### Usage

1. Navigate to the scripts directory:

   ```bash
   cd scripts
   ```

2. Run the script:

   ```bash
   go run add_achievements.go
   ```

### What the script does

The script will add the following achievements to your database:

- **First Steps**: Complete your first activity on Watchlistfy

### Customizing achievements

To add your own achievements, modify the `achievements` slice in the script:

```go
achievements := []Achievement{
    {
        Title:       "Your Achievement Title",
        ImageURL:    "https://your-domain.com/images/achievement.png",
        Description: "Description of what the user needs to do",
        CreatedAt:   time.Now().UTC(),
        UpdatedAt:   time.Now().UTC(),
    },
    // Add more achievements here...
}
```

### Notes

- The script will create new achievements each time it's run - it doesn't check for duplicates
- Make sure to update the image URLs to point to your actual achievement images
- The database name is hardcoded as "watchlistfy" - change it in the script if your database has a different name
